# django-todo-app

It is my first project (not including tutorial) which I made as good learning exercise. I think I do not have explain anyone what to do list is for :)

Python Version: 3.11.9

### How to start working on it?
1. Clone repository from github on your local machine
2. Create python evnironment with `python -m venv .venv`
3. Activate python environment
4. Install all requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. [Optional] Run in terminal `python manage.py livereload`. It allows to refresh webapp in real time
6. Run in other terminal `python manage.py runserver`
7. Your app should be at the default address: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
